# Save cursor position

This plugin is a customized fork of [dy-sh/obsidian-remember-cursor-position](https://github.com/dy-sh/obsidian-remember-cursor-position), tailored to meet my needs.

This [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) plugin enables saving the cursor position and scroll state to a note's frontmatter(metadata) when a designated command is triggered. It also allows restoring the cursor positond and scroll state from the saved frontmatter when file is opened or the corresponding command is activated.

The plugin works in edit view (both preview mode & source code mode). In reading view, the scroll saving and restoring feature works well, but cursor position saving and restoring is not supported.
